## [0.0.1] (2024-04-04)

This is the initial release of the `vectorscan-rs` and `vectorscan-rs-sys` crates.
These crates were extracted from the [Nosey Parker project](https://github.com/praetorian-inc/noseyparker).

The `vectorscan-rs-sys` crate builds a vendored copy of [Vectorscan](https://github.com/Vectorcamp/vectorscan) 5.4.11.
The `vectorscan-rs` crate provides minimal Rust bindings to Vectorscan's block-based matching APIs.
