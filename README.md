# `vectorscan-rs`

## Overview

This repository contains Rust bindings to the high-performance [Vectorscan](https://github.com/Vectorcamp/vectorscan) regular expression library.

The bindings are organized into two crates:

- [`vectorscan-rs`](vectorscan-rs): higher-level Rust bindings
- [`vectorscan-rs-sys`](vectorscan-rs-sys): low-level bindings to a vendored copy of the native Vectorscan library
