# `vectorscan-rs`

## Overview
This crate exposes a more ergonomic Rust interface on top of the raw C bindings to [https://github.com/Vectorcamp/vectorscan](Vectorscan) that are exposed in the [`vectorscan-rs-sys`](../vectorscan-rs-sys) crate.

This crate was originally written as part of [Nosey Parker](https://github.com/praetorian-inc/noseyparker).
This crate was adapted from the [https://github.com/vlaci/pyperscan](pyperscan) project, which uses Rust to expose Hyperscan to Python.
